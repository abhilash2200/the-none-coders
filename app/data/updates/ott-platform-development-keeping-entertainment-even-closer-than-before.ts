      <h2>What is OTT Platform Development?</h2>
      <p>OTT stands for Over-The-Top. It's a service that streams videos, movies, music, or live events over the internet. No satellite. No cable. Just a phone, smart TV, or laptop. OTT Platform Development is the development of such streaming platforms. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, and SonyLIV are popular examples. But new ones are in the making every day for other target audiences.</p>

      <h2>Why Optimize React Apps?</h2>
      <p>Individuals do not wait for TV timetables anymore. They desire to control. They desire to watch what they prefer, where they prefer, and when they prefer.</p>
      <p>OTT platforms enable it. They offer freedom. They bring happiness. A tired worker is enjoying his favourite film at midnight. A kid laughing at cartoons during the afternoon. A family watching a live cricket match together. OTT is not a technology; it's an emotion.</p>
